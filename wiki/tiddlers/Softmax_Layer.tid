In ''multinomial logistic regression'', if we see the process as a set of independent binary regressions, we run $K-1$ independent binary logistic regression models for $K$ possible outcomes. 
$$
\ln\frac{p(y_i=j)}{p(y_i=1)} = \mathbf w^T_j\mathbf x_i+b_j
$$
The probability sum to one so
$$
p(y_i=j) = \frac{\exp(w^T_j\mathbf x_i+b_j)}{1+\sum_{k=2}^K\exp(w^T_k\mathbf x_i+b_k)}
$$
Or we can see it as a log-linear model:
$$
p(y_i=j) = \text{softmax}(j, \mathbf w^T_1\mathbf x_i+b_1, \cdots, \mathbf w^T_K\mathbf x_i+b_K)
$$

The softmax function thus serves as the equivalent of the logistic function in binary logistic regression.
