title: Convex Conjugate
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In case your loss function involves convex functional of the densities (such as in $$f$$-divergences), you can transform your problem by re-expressing it in terms of the convex conjugate. The expression for $$f$$ in terms of its convex conjugate $$f^*$$ is:
$$
f(u) = \underset{v\in\text{dom}(f^*)}{\sup}\{\langle u, v\rangle-f^*(v)\}\ge\underset{\psi}{\sup}\{\langle u, v_\psi\rangle-f(v_\psi)\}
$$
If $$u$$ is a density function, then the inner product $$\langle u, v_\psi\rangle$$ is the expectation of $$v_\psi$$, which can be approximated by Monte Carlo sampling.
