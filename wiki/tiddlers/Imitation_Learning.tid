* given: state & action space, roll-out from $\pi^*$, dynamics model
* goal: recover reward function, then use reward to get policy

The challenges are:

* underdefined problem
* difficult to evaluate a learned reward
* demonstrations may not be precisely optimal

Imitation learning is very similar to GAN:

* a generator generate policy samples from $\pi$ and update policy in the outer loop
* a discriminator update reward using samples & demos and update reward in the inner loop

DeepMind use GAN and VAE to learn human actions: [[Robust Imitation of Diverse Behaviors|https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02747]]
