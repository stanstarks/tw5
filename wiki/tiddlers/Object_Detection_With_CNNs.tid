title: Object Detection With CNNs
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Girshick et al.'s Region-CNN framework is a combination of region proposals and CNN features. It has three broad stages:

# generating object proposals
# extracting CNN feature maps of each proposal
# filtering the proposal through class specific SVMs

The bottleneck of performance of R-CNN is extracting feature maps for each region. In [[Fast R-CNN|Fast-RCNN]], they obtain $100\times$ speedup over R-CNN by computing the CNN features once and pooling them locally for each proposal; they also streamline the last two stages of R-CNN into a single multi-task learning problem. 

After that, the bottleneck becomes region-proposal stage. [[Lenc et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06981]] drop the region proposal and use a constant set of regions learnt through K-means clustering on the PASCAL VOC data. [[Faster RCNN by Ren et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497]] starts from a fixed set of proposal, but refined them prior to detection by using a Region Proposal Network which shares weights with the later detection network and streamlines the multi-stage R-CNN framework.
