[[The exploding gradient problem demystified - definition, prevalence, impact, origin, tradeoffs, and solutions|https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05577]] introduces a rigorous measurement of the present of pathological exploding gradient: Gradient scale coefficient (GSC)

* A random change to $$F_l$$ of relative size $$\frac{1}{GSC(l, L+1)}$$ leads to a change in the error of quadratic expectation $$e(F_l)$$ according to the local linear approximation induced by the network gradient.
* as the GSC increases, the relative size of the region that satisfies the first Wolfe condition shrinks proportionally.
