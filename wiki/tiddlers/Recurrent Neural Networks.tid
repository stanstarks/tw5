! Introduction

RNN is a very deep feedforward neural newwork that has a layer for each timestep. Its weights are shared across time.

* Regularisation
** don't put drop on recurrent connections, on non-recurrent ones. [[Recurrent neural network regularization. Zaremba et al.|https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329]]
** [[A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks. Gal and Ghahramani|https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287]] advocate tying the recurrent dropout mask and sampling at evaluation time.
