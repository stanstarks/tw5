! Theory

* [[LSTM Basic]]
* [[RNN Performance Optimization]]
* Gated Recurrent Units
** [[Revised GRU for speech|https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00641]]: reset gate removed, replaced tanh with ReLU. Probably not very useful for other tasks

! Applications
* Image recognition
** [[Feedback Networks|https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09508]]

* [[Recurrent Highway Networks|http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03474]]
** Residual connection for RNN
* [[A-LSTM|http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06258]]
** a decaying recent hidden state weight matrix called fast accociative memory.
** can be used in visual attention
