	* generator and discriminator nets

this paper developed Deep Convolutional GAN

A stable Deep Convolutional GAN should:

* Replace any pooling layers with strided convolutions (discriminator) and fractional-strided convolutions (generator).
* Use batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator.
* Remove fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures.
* Use ReLU activation in generator for all layers except for the output, which uses Tanh.
* Use LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layers.
