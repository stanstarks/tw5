* Train from manually ''annotated programs'' and avoiding program execution at training time.
* Train model with backprop: limited discrete operations
** low-level memory
** require memory to be differentiable

* introduced a floating parser to address the large amount of variation in utterances and table schema for semantic parsing on web tables.
* [[Seq2SQL|https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00103]]
** attention on aggregation op, select column and where clause
** policy gradient training to deal with condition's order issue. @@color:#859900;Policy net is closely related to synthetic gradient@@
** WikiSQL dataset
