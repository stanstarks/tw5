title: End-to-end Optimized Image Compression
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* [[paper|https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg&noteId=rJxdQ3jeg]]

Generalized divisive normalization. “which has previously been shown to be highly efficient in Gaussianizing the local joint statistics of natural images.” Gaussianizing here means mapping the data onto a normal distribution. The normalisation operation looks like this, where $w_{i}^{(k)}(m,n)$ is the output of the downsampling step,corresponding to spatial location $(m,n)$, and $\beta$, $\gamma$ are learned parameters.

The distortion measure is MSE. Since no reliable perceptual metric for colored image.

Questions

* What is adaptive entropy coder.
* This should be at least useful in generating images.
* Similar to VAE, but approximate the discrete problem along the rate-distortion curve. Study eq 10, the equivalence to VAE holds at least for any norm, and any affine and invertible perceptual transform.
