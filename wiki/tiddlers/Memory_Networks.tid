This family uses a universal access mechanism (c.f. associative computers).

* End-To-End Memory Network: make the supervision indirect, supervision signal on output
* [[Key-Value Memory Network]]: makes matchings more relavant, easy to do pointers.
* Forward Prediction Memory Network
* [[Recurrent Entity Network]]

! Sparse Memory Access
* [[Scaling Memory-Augmented Neural Networks with Sparse Reads and Writes|https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09027]]
** restrict read write size to constant
** kNN memory matching

! Code

! Extensions

* [[Variational Memory Addressing in Generative Models]]

! Remarks
Maybe not the most convenient for all tasks: e.g. we search real computers using many more mechanisms (text, trees, read/write time, title/tags).
