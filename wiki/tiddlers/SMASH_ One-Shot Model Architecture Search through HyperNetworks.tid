type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* Use HyperNet as auxiliary model to learn a transformation from a binary encoding of an architecture to the weight space.
* The weights for each node in our network are dynamically generated

Architecure sampling:

* memory-bank view
* random read/write

Weight sampling:

* HyperNet
