! Summary
We have combined Riemannian geometry with dynamical mean field theory to study the emergent deterministic properties of signal propagation in deep nonlinear nets.

We derived analytic recursion relations for Euclidean length, correlations, curvature, and Grassmannian length as simple input manifolds propagate forward through the network.

We obtain an excellent quantitative match between theory and simulations

Our results reveal the existence of a transient chaotic phase in which the network expands input manifolds without straightening them out, leading to "space filling" curves that explore many dimensions while turning at a constant rate. The number of turns grows exponentially with depth.

Such exponential growth does not happen with width in a shallow net.

Chaotic deep random networks can also take exponentially curved N-1 Dimensional decision boundaries in the input and flatten them into Hyperplane decision boundaries in the final layer: exponential disentangling!

An order to chaos phase transition governs the dynamics of random deep networks, often used for initialization.

Not all networks at the edge of chaos - with neither vanishing nor exploding gradients are created equal.

The entire Jacobian singular value distribution, and not just its second moment impacts learning speed.

We used introduced free probability theory to deep learning to compute this entire distribution.

We found tanh networks with orthogonal weights have well conditioned Jacobians, but ReLU networks with orthogonal weights, or any network with Gaussian weights does not.

Correspondingly, we found that with orthogonal weights, tanh networks learn Faster than ReLU networks.
