Looking forward to off the convex path's new post and paper on GAN.

The generator tries to maximize $E_u[f(D(G(h)))]$. The original GAN uses $f(x)=\log(x)$, making the training more sentitive to terrible generations. If generator wins, $P_{real}$ and $P_{synth}$ are close in JS divergence. While [[WGAN]] uses $f(x)=x$, the two distributions are close in Wasserstein or earth-mover distance. In practice, the analysis can be very off.
