title: Diffeomorphic Transformation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Diffeomorphic transformations defines a bijective tranformation between two image domains. They have topology preserving charactersitics.

The transformation is defined as

$$
f = \exp(v)
$$

where $$v$$ is the input vector field. The inverse transformation can be obtained by

$$
f = \exp(-v)
$$
