Welcome to my personal wiki. I think it would be helpful if I share my notes. I kept my notes in a very non-linear way. So be sure to dig really deep until you find what you are looking for.

Here are some nice places to start:

* [[Deep Learning]]: This is the root of deep learning related materials I am following.
* [[Deep Learning Bib]]: I write some of my paper summaries here.
* [[Readings]]: Some good old resources.
* [[Speech]]: If you are interested in my works during graduate study. 
* [[Programming]]: Here are some more hackery stuff, focusing majorly on [[clojure]].

''Notice'': please don't change anything.
