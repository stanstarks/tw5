type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* Training techniques to deal with
** [[Adversarial Examples]] in classification
** [[Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in NNs]]
** mode collapse in generative modelling
* Making deep networks amenable to (stable!) online updates from weakly supervised data
** True lifelong learning and open up many applications
* "Batch normalization" for GANs or Deep RL
** make everything wants to train by default
* Moving away from supervised learning
** [[Capsules]]
** efficiently use data for more complex problems
** Come up with better exploration strategies as well as active learning approaches to acquire the relevant information while keeping training manageable
* Build single machine learning system that can solve thousands or millions of tasks and can draw from the experience in solving these tasks to learn to automatically solve new tasks.

* Biologically plausible neural net systems
* Exactly solvable DNN models (through symmetry & group theory)
* New/better learning algorithms & design principles
* Predictions on the organization of biological layered networks
