* Analyzing a Decade of Linux System Calls
** System calls and related commits are extracted
** analyze the commit type and draw some empirical conclusions
** find patterns in API evolution
** some conclusions about software developments are drawn
* Towards a Better Understanding of the Impact of Experimental Components on Defect Prediction
** very nice thesis on defect prediction

Bug localization

* Information Retrieval and Spectrum Based Bug Localizatin: Better Together
** use bug report to query defected code parts
* Compositional Vector Space Models for Improved Bug Localization
** more data but only searching for file
** solving LDA with GA seems so weird

similar to a learn to rank task

* Synergizing Specification Miners through Model Fissions and Fusions
** static program analysis for documentation
** construct FSA from execution traces
** fissing FSA to common blocks
** fuse FSA from a set of LTL constraints
* Who Should Review This Change? Putting Text and File Location Analyses Together for More Accurate Recommendations
** text recommendation system to suggest best reviewer for certain piece of code
** description field of review request in important, also the changed file directory
** another learn to rank task
* What Are the Characteristics of High-Rated Apps? A Case Study on Free Android Applications
** a hypothesis testing on 28 factors of 1,492 apps to the ratings
** didn't find the description but inferring from the dataset and results, I guess they are doing a 2-class classification.
* Whatâ€™s Hot in Software Engineering Twitter Space?
** Social network mining on twitter
** Filter out related tweets, rule based methods
* Deep Learning for Just-In-Time Defect Prediction
** a simple classification task with RBM, no gimmicks.
