type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Making Neural Programming Architectures Generalize via Recursion|https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06611]]

Challenges:

* Generalization to more complex inputs
* Proof of generalization

Approach:

* Instantiation: incorporate recursion into Neural Programmer-Interpreter
* Training methods: As a first step, strong supervision with explicit execution traces to learn a recursive neural program

! NPI

* input: environment observation
* list of predefined functions
* NPI controller: A LSTM takes observation and caller func/args as inputs, modifies states and emits next operation

NPI is trained with execution traces divided by caller functions.
