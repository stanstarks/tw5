title: Gibbs Sampling
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Letting $$\theta = (\theta_1, \dots, \theta_p)'$$, we draw subsets of $$\theta$$ from their exact conditional poster distributions fixing the others.

It takes an unnormalized distribution which can be specified by a factor graph, along with a list of variables values that can be arbitrarily initialized. Gibbs sampling iteratively selects a variable and then samples the chosen variable from its conditional distribution.

! Scan order in Gibbs sampling
The scan order in Gibbs sampling determines which variable is selected in each step:

# random scan
# systematic scan selects a fixed permutation and repeatedly samples the variables in that order

In [[Scan Order in Gibbs Sampling: Models in Which it Matters and Bounds on How Much|https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03432]], a theorem bounding the relative mixing times of random and systematic scan is proved. Under mild conditions, this theorem implies that the mixing times differ by only polynomial factors.
